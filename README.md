Learn Flask by creating a Translation Web App

## HELPFUL COMANDS
To run our app:
# flask --app app.py --debug run

You can also use the following command to run the app:
# flask run
But this won't restart the server automatically when you make a change in the code. You will have to stop the server and run the command again.
